The project is nearly complete, with our machine learning model up and running, collecting brain data and focusing on certain types. The circuit has been compressed into a far smaller board in an effort to have less room for error with the lack in quality of these chips. The stages still exist as they had previously, but now they are being stacked. 

We will need to collect more brain data to be certain that the pong game works. Right now, it does not work as we want it to, but we foresee with more peopleâ€™s brain data that it will work more easily for others. Our current method of drawing data from people involves a long process of first tracking focus state data for 10 minutes and then tracking relaxed state data for 10 minutes. We plan on decreasing the time for other people's data collection, unless people volunteer to do the longer test.

1. What did the team work on this past week?  
   

| Task | Task Lead | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ML Model | Kyle Stallings | Complete | The model is complete with a method used to differentiate active versus relaxed |
| ML data | Kyle Stallings | Nearly Complete | We have some good data, but more is needed to finish |
| Final Hardware System | Sam Huang | Nearly Complete | Just need to solder |

   

2. What feedback has the team received?

| From Whom | Feedback | Next Steps |

| NA | NA | NA |

   

3. Are any resources needed? If so, what?

The hardware components are still being swapped in and out as the reliability of the components get tested. We have now gone over budget with these components, but we believe it is still well within a manageable range.

What are your plans for this next week?

| Task | Task Lead | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Finish getting data for ml model | Kyle/Pravar | While we have some data, ideally more data would allow for a better model |
| Move the circuit to a protoboard | Greg/Sam | To ensure portability and no issues with loose wires |
