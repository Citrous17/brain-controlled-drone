1. Give yourselves a pat on the back\! List the teamâ€™s accomplishments.  
   1. **Frontend built with a database**  
   2. The preamps work in amplifying data  
   3. Have basic circuit layout and implementation  
   4. Basic front and back end created  
   5. Filters implemented and tested for the preamplifier circuit.  
   6. Different filter viability and options tested, and relevant ones have been implemented. 

2. How is the team doing with communication? How will the team adjust going forward?   
   1. **We are communicating frequently, reporting work done and work that needs to be done**   
   2. **We will have to have meetings more frequently to catch up on our timeline**

3. How is the team doing with time? (Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?) How will the team adjust going forward?   
   1. **We are a little behind schedule, specifically because certain components do not work as expected and resolving it would require creative spending**  
   2. **We have spent over 15 hours in the lab working on the preamplifier circuit and are beginning to feel the pressure of time, as this is only one node, and we still have to solder our final configurations and replicate it.** 

| Keep doing | Start doing | Stop doing |
