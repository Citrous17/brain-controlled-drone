Each circuit stage has been tested and shown to work. We are currently focusing on combining each stage for testing along with building a second iteration on a protoboard. Transferring to the protoboard created a ton of issues and wasted a lot of time trying to debug what was wrong. To remedy this, going through each step and double checking each connection proved to increase the accuracy and reduce error. The initial AD620 stage has been modified to include an offset part to set a 0V DC bias for the inputs. This part has been validated and integrated with the AD620. After the circuit is validated and Brain Data is found, we will finish the soldered prototype and begin headset development, and further testing. 

On the software side, socket connections are complete between the Arduino Nano and the Raspberry Pi, and the Raspberry Pi to the Client Laptop. As well, a Wave Visualizer has been added to visualize the readings in real time. It can be expanded upon so that each of the Waveform channels (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.) are shown separately. Furthermore, improvements were made to the inverse FFT so that signals are shown more accurately, as compared to signals generated by the oscilloscope. A CSV function was made to take in the frequency response, and the gain magnitude to recreate the signal. This will serve as a backup or even the file to be displayed to the client laptop.

1. What did the team work on this past week?  
   

| Task | Task Lead | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Wave Visualizer | Kyle Stallings | Halfway complete | The wave visualizer works, however it doesnâ€™t configure with other parts of the code |
| Soldered Prototype | Samuel Huang |  | The first stage is soldered on, but waiting for validating of the bradboarded prototype.  |
| Evaluation Summary  | Kyle Stallings | Complete | We finished the capstone report evaluation plan  |

   

2. What feedback has the team received?

| From Whom | Feedback | Next Steps |

| NA | NA | NA |

   

3. Are any resources needed? If so, what?

Hardware segments are being tested and integrated within the system.  The next step is integration of a power supply for the circuit.  WIth the prototype complete, we will need to get more parts to create  multiple nodes.

What are your plans for this next week?

| Task | Task Lead | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Replicate and consolidate Circuit Prototype, using soldered resistors and capacitors to reduce space. | Sam Huang/ Gerg | Components have been combined and stages are being soldered on.  |
| Test Neural Case | Kyle Stallings / Pravar  | When connected to the user and the user is not thinking about anything see what the system is showing. |
| Test Wrong Connection Case | Kyle Stallings / Pravar  | If only one node is touching then there will be clipping and as such we should give an error or warning. |
| Test When no one is wearing the system | Kyle Stallings / Pravar  | Make sure that the system is showing a flatline that is not the same as clipping from only having a node on. IE make sure that the value is 0\. |
| Test Signal Fidelity | Kyle Stallings / Pravar | Input signal amplitudes through filter stages 2-4 into the arduino, starting from 10 mA up to 50 mA incrementing by 5 mA each time with frequencies varying from 10 \- 50 Hz incrementing by 5 Hz. Ensure the system does not clip with a 50mA 40 Hz signal beforehand and adjust the adjustable gain if necessary. |
| Update Butterworth | Gerg | Update the sixth stage of the Butterworth system to have a 61k resistor instead of a 100k. |
| Create a CSV function that takes in two files | Kyle Stallings / Pravar | Create a CSV file that takes in the CSV Frequency Response file of the stage 1, and the file of stage 2-4 to get the associated gain magnitude (not in DB) at each frequency. |
| Update the second Twin T | Gerg | Update the values of all resistors and capacitors to be as accurate to what is simulated as possible as the closer the numbers are to each other the deeper the notch. Also consider changing the values in the R3 and R4 setup. |
| Wave Visualizer | Kyle Stallings / Pravar | Clean up teh wave visualization function to display the four wave categories in real time. |
