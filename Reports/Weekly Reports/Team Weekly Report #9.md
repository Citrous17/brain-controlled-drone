The circuit currently consists of 4 stages. Each stage is being incrementally tested and soldered onto protoboards, with the initial AD620 and Butter worth stage having a soldered component. We were able to get a functioning prototype, but changes have been made and the prototype does not currently work. 

On the software side, the Pong game has been created and integrated with a Machine Learning model to predict a user's actions based on their alpha and beta brainwaves. In the future, the Model will be expanded to include the theta, gamma, and delta brainwaves. As well, the database will be expanded upon to keep the data sets from multiple users so that the machine learning model will have more to work on. As well, there is a script for just visualizing the brainwaves signals so that the signal strength for each brainwave band can be analyzed.

1. What did the team work on this past week?  
   

| Task | Task Lead | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Wave Visualizer | Kyle Stallings | Complete | Each type of wave is fleshed out  |
| Pong Game | Kyle Stallings | Complete | A simple pong game was created |
| Pong \+ Machine Learning Integration | Kyle stallings | In Progress | The Machine Learning Model was created but still needs to be refined |
| Updated full circuit | Samuel Huang | Almost complete | Many of the circuits are mostly complete, however just need to make sure the proto boards are perfect |
| Testing Node Cases | Pravar Chetan | Complete | Plenty of testing is complete going over the quality of values we are receiving when testing, especially checking depending on the types of connections |

   

2. What feedback has the team received?

| From Whom | Feedback | Next Steps |

| NA | NA | NA |

   

3. Are any resources needed? If so, what?

The hardware components are still being swapped in and out as the reliability of the components get tested through testing. We have now gone over budget with these components, but we believe it is still well within a manageable range.

| Plans for Next Week |

What are your plans for this next week?

| Task | Task Lead | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Improve upon the Machine Learning Model | Kyle / Pravar | The machine learning model needs to be improved upon so that noise can be mitigated and to include more brainwave bands |
| Fully integrated Proto Boards | Sam / Greg |  |
